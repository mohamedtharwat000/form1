# Project Title

Simple Form Validation

## Description

This project implements a simple client-side and server-side form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form contains fields for name, email, and password. Form data is validated on submit, and error messages are displayed if any field is invalid.

The main goals of this project are:

- Practice form validation using JavaScript to ensure data integrity
- Provide a user-friendly experience with clear validation messages and visual cues
- Implement a responsive and mobile-friendly form layout for seamless usage across devices
- Showcase clean and maintainable HTML and CSS code

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo of the form [here](https://mohamedtharwat000.github.io/form1/).

Try submitting the form with both invalid and valid values to see the validation in action.
